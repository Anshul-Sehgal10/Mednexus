# Changes Made - Next.js SSR Fix Session

**Date:** August 19, 2025  
**Objective:** Fix "window is not defined" SSR (Server-Side Rendering) errors during Next.js build process

## Problem
The Next.js build was failing with multiple "ReferenceError: window is not defined" errors on pages that used browser-specific APIs (localStorage, navigator.geolocation) and Leaflet maps during server-side rendering.

## Pages Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.jsx`)

**Issues Fixed:**
- `localStorage.getItem()` called during server-side rendering
- `navigator.geolocation` accessed without browser environment check
- Leaflet components causing SSR issues

**Changes:**
- Removed `localStorage` access from initial state initialization
- Added proper browser environment checks with `typeof window !== "undefined"`
- Dynamically imported Leaflet components with `{ ssr: false }`
- Added client-side icon initialization with `iconsInitialized` state
- Added loading states for both user data and map components

### 2. Emergency Page (`src/app/Emergency/page.jsx`)

**Issues Fixed:**
- `localStorage.getItem()` called during server-side rendering
- `navigator.geolocation` accessed without browser environment check
- Leaflet components causing SSR issues

**Changes:**
- Added browser environment check for `localStorage` access
- Added proper `navigator.geolocation` browser check
- Dynamically imported Leaflet components with `{ ssr: false }`
- Added client-side icon initialization with `iconsInitialized` state
- Added conditional map rendering with loading fallback

### 3. Hospital Page (`src/app/hospital/page.jsx`)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Leaflet icon initialization causing SSR issues
- Missing browser environment checks

**Changes:**
- Moved Leaflet icon creation inside browser environment check
- Added dynamic imports for Leaflet components
- Added client-side icon initialization pattern

## Technical Solutions Applied

### 1. Dynamic Imports for Leaflet
```javascript
const MapContainer = dynamic(
  () => import("react-leaflet").then((mod) => mod.MapContainer),
  { ssr: false }
);
```

### 2. Browser Environment Checks
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    // Browser-only code here
  }
}, []);
```

### 3. Client-Side Icon Initialization
```javascript
let blueIcon, redIcon;

if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  const L = require("leaflet");
  // Icon creation here
}
```

### 4. Conditional Rendering
```javascript
{iconsInitialized && typeof window !== "undefined" ? (
  <MapContainer>
    // Map components
  </MapContainer>
) : (
  <div>Loading map...</div>
)}
```

## Build Result
âœ… **SUCCESS** - Build now completes without SSR errors  
Exit Code: 0

## Files Modified
- `src/app/dashboard/page.jsx`
- `src/app/Emergency/page.jsx` 
- `src/app/hospital/page.jsx`

## Key Lessons
1. Always check for browser environment before accessing browser APIs
2. Use dynamic imports with `{ ssr: false }` for components that require browser APIs
3. Implement proper loading states for client-side only content
4. Move library initializations that depend on browser APIs to `useEffect` hooks
5. Use conditional rendering to prevent SSR mismatches

## Notes
- The ESLint warning about "Cannot serialize key 'parse' in parser" still appears but doesn't break the build
- All pages now properly handle SSR and client-side hydration
- Maps and geolocation features work correctly on the client side while avoiding SSR issues
